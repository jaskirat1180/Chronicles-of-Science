          Two subjects I love: <strong>history</strong> and <strong>biology</strong>. This blog brings the two together in uncovering
          the unimaginabe but deeply fascinating history of science that has paved the way for modern medicine.
          If you are as interested in biological discovery as I am, keep up with my blog for short chronicles of science!
